Real-time Stock Price Tracking App

This is a simple real-time stock price tracking application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WebSockets. The app displays real-time stock prices for a few selected stocks (e.g., AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN) and updates the prices dynamically using a WebSocket connection.

Customization

Add More Stocks
To add more stocks, update the following files:

1. HTML:
   Add a new stock element in `index.html`:
   ```html
   <div class="stock">
       <span class="stock-symbol">TSLA</span>
       <span class="stock-price">$0.00</span>
   </div>
   ```

2. Server:
   Add the stock symbol to the `stocks` array in `server.js`:
   ```javascript
   const stocks = [
       { symbol: 'AAPL', price: getRandomStockPrice() },
       { symbol: 'GOOGL', price: getRandomStockPrice() },
       { symbol: 'AMZN', price: getRandomStockPrice() },
       { symbol: 'TSLA', price: getRandomStockPrice() } // New stock
   ];
   ```
